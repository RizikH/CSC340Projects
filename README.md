# rest-api(prediction-api

## Demo for a simple Prediction API service.
-used the rest-API provided by my instructor in the CSC340 class at UNCG(Sunny Ntini).
The changes I made to their code is the addition of a method called getPrediction in the main to send a request to the API: "https://api.genderize.io/?name=" with a user inputted name and output a prediction of that name's gender with a confidence chance.
